Description:

This utility serves to allow the user to rename files en masse, without the need to access them individually. Simply
select a directory to read files from and they will be listed in the central pane for renaming. This can also extend to
the ID3 tags in the case of media files. 

Basic Instructions:

1. Select a directory to read files from.
2. Rename any files desired that appear in the central pane.
3. Hit the 'Start' button to have the utility edit the files.

Notes:

-The extensions of the files to look for can be customized via the 'Set Extensions' button. 
-The 'Top Level Folder Only' checkbox refers to whether or not to access sub-directories.
-The 'Current Prefix' textbox is prepended to all files that are renamed before the value in the central pane textboxes.
-The 'Set Metadata' checkbox will edit the ID3 title tag to match the newly renamed file. (This only applies to media files)
-By default, video files are searched.
-The code to change tags other than the title is commented out since it is beyond my intentions for this utility and isn't very well tested.
	If it is uncommented it should work fine, with some tweaks to accomodate later changes, but is certainly not guaranteed to do so.
